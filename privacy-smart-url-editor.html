    <h1>Smart URL Editor – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"> <strong> Nov 2025 </strong></p>

    <p>
      Smart URL Editor is a Chrome extension that helps users view and edit URL parameters within a browser side panel.
      This extension is designed to work entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, transfer, or sell your
      personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Accessed</h2>
    <p>
      Smart URL Editor needs access to a small amount of information in order to provide its core functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Active tab URL</strong> – The extension reads the URL of the tab you are currently viewing so it can display and edit its query parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The extension does <strong>not</strong> access the contents of web pages (such as text, images, or form data), and it
      does <strong>not</strong> access your browsing history beyond the currently active tab’s URL.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collected</h2>
    <p>Smart URL Editor does not collect or store any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, or account details)</li>
      <li>Health information</li>
      <li>Financial or payment information</li>
      <li>Authentication credentials (passwords, tokens, or security questions)</li>
      <li>Personal communications (emails, messages, or chat logs)</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Full browsing history</li>
      <li>Keystrokes, mouse movements, or other detailed user activity</li>
      <li>Website content (page text, images, videos, or file uploads)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties. All processing occurs locally within your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Permissions</h2>
    <p>Smart URL Editor uses the following Chrome extension permissions strictly for its single purpose:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>activeTab</strong> – to read the URL of the tab you are currently viewing when you open the extension.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>tabs</strong> – to update the active tab’s URL after you apply changes to its query parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>scripting</strong> – to run a small script that reads and updates URL parameters as you interact with the extension.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>sidePanel</strong> – to display the extension’s interface in Chrome’s side panel.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These permissions are used only to support the extension’s core functionality of viewing and editing URL parameters.
      They are not used for tracking or profiling users.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Smart URL Editor does not use analytics, advertising networks, or any third-party tracking scripts. The extension does
      not execute remote code or load external JavaScript from remote servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Sale</h2>
    <p>
      Since Smart URL Editor does not collect user data, it does not share or sell any data to third parties.
      We do not use or transfer data for purposes unrelated to the extension’s single purpose, and we do not use or
      transfer data for creditworthiness or lending decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Smart URL Editor does not target or knowingly collect information from children. The extension simply operates on the
      active tab URL in your browser and does not collect personal data of any kind.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the effective date at the top of this page.
      Your continued use of Smart URL Editor after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
